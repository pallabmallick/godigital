                            <p>Ans: First we say, we follow our company rules step by step:
                            <ul>
                                    <li> First, our project manager discuss about the project/website in details. If needed, our project manager can discuss many times. If we are capable to complete the project then we confirm you for ordering the project and clearly discuss about the project price.</li>
                                    

                                    <li> At the time of ordering, all the project details with project price and advance payment written in two copies of our company letter head paper. One copy is for our client and another for us. And both copies are duly singed by both parties. So there is no confusion for project flow and price.</li>

                                    <li> After ordering , we start layout design of home page. Then it is sent to customer for approval. If there is any modification needed then we update the template. We update the template until the client is satisfied.</li>

                                    <li> After the design is approved, then we start development of project.</li>

                                    <li> After completion of project, we start testing and then we give it to the client for checking.</li>

                                    <li> After final approval of the client, we upload the website on main domain.</li>

                            </ul>
